🚀 Real-World Machine Learning with DKG! 💡

I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with DKG on a school project, working alongside four talented friends to tackle a real-world 
data science challenge. Our mission? Predicting whether a dishwasher fits in a 3D kitchen modeling program! 🏡🔍

What made this experience truly exciting was working with real company data, applying machine learning techniques, and seeing our models make 
an impact. I took the lead on feature engineering, data processing, model fitting, and fine-tuning—ensuring our predictions were as accurate 
and efficient as possible.

I’m really proud of what we accomplished, and this project reinforced my passion for data-driven problem-solving. Excited to take on more 
challenges in the future! 🚀
