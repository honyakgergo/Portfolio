ðŸš€ Progress Tracker - A Flask-Based Web App for Tracking Exercise Sessions

I developed Progress Tracker, a Flask-based web application designed to help users create, manage, and track their exercise sessions efficiently. The project showcases my skills in web development, database management, authentication, and user experience design.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… User Authentication & Authorization: Implemented secure login, registration, and session management using Flask-Login and bcrypt for password hashing.
âœ… Database Management: Designed and managed relational data using SQLAlchemy and Flask SQLAlchemy, ensuring efficient CRUD operations.
âœ… Dynamic Content Rendering: Built an interactive UI with Jinja templates, allowing users to create, update, and delete workout sessions.
âœ… Form Handling & Validation: Used WTForms for seamless user input validation and data management.
âœ… Access Control & Security: Enforced user-based access controls, preventing unauthorized actions.

ðŸ’¡ Skills Gained & Applied:
ðŸ”¹ Flask & Python: Developed a full-fledged MVC-based web app.
ðŸ”¹ SQLAlchemy: Built and queried databases for session and user data storage.
ðŸ”¹ Authentication & Security: Implemented hashed passwords and session-based user authentication.
ðŸ”¹ Frontend-Backend Integration: Connected the UI with business logic using Flask routing and templating.
ðŸ”¹ Deployment & Debugging: Tested and optimized the application for smooth performance.

This project strengthened my understanding of Flask development, database interactions, web security, and user experience design. Excited to continue building innovative web applications!

Here you can find the application I have been talking about. In the app, you have to create an account or use the data from data.py to sign in. After that, you can add workout plans, and you can even edit or delete them, but only those that are yours.
For example you can use this account to test my app:
