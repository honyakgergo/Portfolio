🚀 Features
📸 Real-Time Camera Integration
Capture images of waste directly from your webcam through a sleek, phone-like interface.

🖼️ Image Upload Option
Prefer uploading? Choose an image from your device to classify instead.

🤖 ML-Powered Waste Detection
All images are sent to a /predict route that returns the predicted waste type. The app uses two ML models:

1. Custom CNN

Built with 3 convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout.

Trained on both original and augmented datasets.

Accuracy:

76.8% (original)

69.4% (augmented, due to challenging rotations and distortions)

2. Transfer Learning with MobileNet

Fine-tuned on the augmented dataset using ImageNet weights.

Test Accuracy: 97.7%

Exceptional precision and recall across all waste categories.

Minimal and often ambiguous misclassifications.

🗑️ Smart Bin Visualization
Automatically displays a color-coded bin (e.g., blue for paper, yellow for plastic) based on the predicted waste type.

👤 User Authentication
Secure account system using Flask-Login

New users can register via /register

Passwords securely hashed with bcrypt

Session-based login/logout support

🌐 Responsive, Clean UI
User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless experience across devices.
