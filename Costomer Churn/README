📊 Kaggle - Customer Churn Prediction Project
Welcome to my Customer Churn Prediction project on Kaggle! 🚀 In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, helping businesses 
understand customer retention and take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates.

📝 Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Customer churn is a critical challenge for many businesses as it directly impacts revenue. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take 
targeted actions to retain them and improve long-term customer relationships.

Objective:
The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that can accurately predict customer churn based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning, the 
project aims to help businesses predict churn rates and take preemptive measures.
